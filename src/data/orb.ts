 * Each palette is four stops, deep to light, plus a glint: a neighbouring hue
 * the shader only lets in at the brightest points, which is what keeps a
 * one-hue orb from reading flat. A stop is a hex, or a custom property name
 * the renderer resolves off :root (so a token change would land here too).
 * The palettes here are plain hex, so they don't depend on the page's theme.
